   This is the product of a hurried 12 hour evening of programming and
a few debugging sessions.   It's not particularly pretty and bugs
exist I am sure.   Use at your own risk.   That said, it's been
running fine for me for a couple months or so.


lib/CGI*
lib/Date/*
lib/AsciiDB/*
	These are all modules written by others.   The CGI and DateManip
packages are unmodified.   I have modified AsciiDB and made notes
regarding the changes in each .pm file.   They are all available at
your nearest CPAN site (see http://www.perl.com/).

DB/description/
	An entry for whenever a user joins or leaves the ladder, and also
	an entry for each match reported. 
DB/users/
	The user records, win/loss, passwords, names, etc.
DB/save/
	When a user leaves the ladder using the delete_user.cgi program
	their entry from DB/users/ is moved here.

cgi/
	This directory contains the CGI programs that the players use to
	create and update their accounts.

lib/Globals.pm
	This is a configuration file.
lib/Rball.pm
	The heart of the ladder, this class is called by all the CGI's to
	update the ladder.
lib/Misc.pm
	Miscellaneous helpful functions I use all over the place.


   This code requires perl 5.004 or later (available at
http://www.perl.com/).

   To install, edit the Rball.pm config file.   Change the
#!/usr/local/bin/perl lines in the CGI files in cgi/ to wherever Perl
is at your site.  Fire up a browser, point it to disthtml/index.html,
and try creating a user.


   If you use this it'd be cool if you let me know.   Feel free to
email me if you run into problems and I would really like to know if
you make any improvements.   I don't promise to answer questions
quickly or even at all, but I'll do my best.
