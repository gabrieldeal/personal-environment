* About liblkrs

   liblkrs is a simple and (probably) portable library for detecting
memory leaks, and a couple other less likely errors.   It works by
using macros to replace memory allocation and deallocation function
calls with calls from liblkrs; recording information in a log file;
and then, after the program has finished, examining this file for
errors.
   I wrote liblkrs because, at the time, I wasn't able to find a
library for debugging memory leaks that would compile on the OS I use.
Since then I've discovered and been using memdebug, which seems to be
very portable and is available at:
ftp://ftp.crpht.lu/pub/sources/memdebug/

   Some other packages worth looking into are:

Plumber - identify the memory leaks 
http://www.ics.uci.edu/~softtest/plumber/

GNU Checker - finds memory errors at runtime
http://www.gnu.org/software/checker/checker.html

Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage collector

Electric Fencedetect when software overruns the boundaries of a
malloc() and any accesses of memory that has been released by free().
