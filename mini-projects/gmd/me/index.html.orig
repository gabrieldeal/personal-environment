		All about me.   Hmmmm, well here is something that my friend Laura once
		told me:
		<Pre>
		you know, you could be considered a nerd. you don't look like one, but
		you have a computer and math major, you get excited about the new TeX,
		etc. why don't you get out more?</Pre>
		She's always awfully nice to me.
		<P>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	   So I have a BS, double major in math and computer science, from the
		University of 
		Washington (1999).   The UW's a wonderful school, particulary the 
		Computer Science Department, which I feel very lucky to have been
		a part of.   Currently, I'm working in Seattle as a programmer at
		an e-commerce business (<a href="2001-01-25-PacMed-floor5-Seattle.jpg">the view from my window</a>).

		WHAT DO YOU ENJOY DOING GABRIEL?
		<Br>
		hmmmmm...

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I love a
		good book, there are few things better, a short list of my favorites is: <U>The
		Lord of the Rings</U>, Tad William's <U>Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn</U>
		trilogy, Adam's <U>Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy</U>, Dumas' <U>The Count of Monte
		Cristo</U>, Pirsig's <U>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenence</U>,
		James Hilton's <U>Random Harvest</U>, and anything by Charles de Lint.
		<Br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		And what would
		life be without music? again a few of my fav's are:  Suzanne Vega,
		The Beastie Boys, Sky Cries Mary, The Creatures, David Bowie, 311,
		Squirrel Nut Zippers, Steeleye Span, Combustible Edison, Plastilina Mosh, and so much
		more.

		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
		I'm a down-hill skier (when I can afford it), and I play racquetball and tennis, and ride my bicycle a lot (mostly to work).
		And I love juggling and flower sticks!   I'm working on my 5-ball right now, I can't
		keep them up for long.   I also juggle clubs and can do a good number
		of different patterns with them, and with 3 and 4 balls.   I'm even
		semi-professional! -- to kill
		time while waiting for my bus at the Greyhound station, I sat in line
		and did 3-ball patterns.   I made $3.53, I totally wasn't expecting
		it, it was pretty fun I thought.
		<Br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	   One more thing I enjoy a lot is sleeping.   I think sleep is a
	real great idea and I'm working on fitting more of it into my
	schedule. 
	
		<P>
		So what do I look like?   My mom I'm told, but I don't see the
		resemblance.   I'm 6 foot 3 with long
		brown hair.   And now I even have a
		<A Href="AIgroup2.jpg">picture</A>
		of myself, I'm the one in the middle, we were trying
		to smirk for the camera, I'm not sure if that explains all 
		our expressions.
